Why invertedv?

It was inspired by a type of [antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_vee_antenna). This was my
go-to antenna in my ham radio days (WD8AZJ). It was relatively compact, cheap and good enough.

The choice was the result of a little game I made up.  The object of the game is to select a domain
name.  The rules are:

1. It has to be a .com.
2. It has to be available.
3. It should be easy to spell and easy to tell to someone verbally.
4. It should have some personal meaning.

It's not that easy! Give it a try!

invertedv ticks *almost* all these boxes.  It turns out to be a bit harder to tell someone I'm
will@invertedv.com than I thought. I've had people ask where the upside down V is on the keyboard.
Oh, well.

I liked it, too, because I though it lended itself to a nice icon--thank you
