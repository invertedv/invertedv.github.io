I'm a statistician who likes to write code and build forecasting models.  I've worked in financial
services, network TV, and tech. 


### More Information

I started programming way-back-when in Pascal as an intern for 
[MDSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicon).  My project was to write a spelling checker!

I ended up earning a PhD in statistics from Texas A&M with an emphasis in statistical computing.

I've written user applications in VB, VBA (*sigh*, yes this is possible) and Python.  These days
I write in Go whenever possible.  My apps have generally been a delivery system for models that
I've built.

Being a statistician, there's been plenty of SAS and R/Splus,  as well.

When I joined Google in 2018, I was the only data scientist hired
through the [Rabbit Hole](https://thehustle.co/the-secret-google-interview-that-landed-me-a-job/).

Here's my profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-alexander-data-scientist).
